## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in generating FPGA design, the final mission is to design a FPGA product with the similar function as Xilinx [XCZU9EG-2FFVB1156C](https://starriver-electronics.com/product/details/xilinx-inc/xczu9eg-2ffvb1156c.html)

### Step 1
There is some issue delay the process and the team is working on it.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a  `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final result and debug.
